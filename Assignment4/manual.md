{ TipCalculator App }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This app is used to calculate the amount of tips individuals would pay, as well as the total amount that the individual would pay (including tip) if a party were to evenly split the check at a resturant.

The app accepts two values of input, one inputText area accepts the value of the check, and the other accepts the number of people in one's party.

Once the compute tip button is pressed, the app will output how much each individual person would have to pay for the tip (assuming that they are evenly splitting the bill, and that they will pay either 15%, 20%, or 25% in tips).

Below the calculated tip values, the total amount of money that each person would have to pay (including the tip) is listed out for each percentage mark.

In the case that a faulty input is found, a toast will appear and notify the user that the input they have given is invalid, and allows them to retry with another set of values.
